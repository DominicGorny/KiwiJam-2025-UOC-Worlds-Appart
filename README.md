Game made for the 2025 KiwiJam. The theme was "connection". In our game the two players are connected by an invisible string which acts as a metaphor for their love. Player can only interact with the purple blocks and the blocks of their colour. The goal the game is to get to the top and claim the secret prize.

Controls:

Blue Player: WASD to move 

Red Player: Arrow keys to move

Not all assets, code, and design were created during this year's Kiwijam. The basis of the project was the Unity 2D Platformer tutorial, and generative AI was used for some code artifacts.
